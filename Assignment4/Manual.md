This app helps you to encrypt or decrypt the message following by the rule of caesar cipher, the rule is as follow.

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 

For the use of the app

Open app SDP Cipher

Enter the Message, the message must include at one character(a-z or A-Z). Enter the shift number, this integer must be greater or equal to 1 and smaller or equal to 25. Click the button option whether encrypt or decrypt the message.

Press "Run Cipher"

This will display the result message. Numbers, symbols and spaces will remain unchanged, it will only change the alphabet.

TROUBLE SHOOTING

If you receive an error of invalid message, you may either forget to input the message you want to encrypt/decrypt or your message contains no alphabet, which means the result message will be same as the input message.

If you receive an error of invalid shift number, you may either forget to input the shift number or your shift number is too small/too large. 

If you received an error of Missing encode option, you may just forget to click the button of whether encrypt or decrypt.
